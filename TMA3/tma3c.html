                    <p>
                        The final assignment of COMP466 required me to develop 4 web applications. The first of these
                        web applications is a frontend application that would use cookies to track how many times a user visited the 
                        application, in addition to displaying their IP address and timezone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second web application is similiar to assignment 1. This application would run a slideshow, using a 
                        list of pictures stored on the server. It includes buttons to start and stop the slideshow, and change the
                        transition from a sequential ordering to a random one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third and fourth parts revolve around building a computer store. This store contains a multitude of 
                        features. Users are able to browse existing models, look up specific parts (such as graphics and Cpus) and then select
                        and customize that computer. The customization allows a user to change any number of components to either more expensive or different
                        ones. The price is then updated dynamically as a user modifies their system. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, a user can add a computer to a cart, which can be removed.  
                        In part 3, the design required me to not use a database, but rather hardcoded values. Part 4 extended this basic system by adding
                        a database, user authentication, and orders.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="documentation-section">
                    <div class="documentation-subtitle">Part 1</div>
                    <span class="documentation-subdivider"></span>
                    <p>
                        To initially set up the application, I used a Django project and configured it to contain four seperate applications,
                        contained within the folders part1, part2, part3 and part4. In part1, a single Django view is used to serve index.html, which
                        contains a basic html page with a top bar for navigation back home. This is setup in Django by defining a proper route.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Routing in Django is done via adding a pattern to urls.py, which the Django engine matches with the incoming request. In views.py,
                        Django requests are handled with a corresponding function. For part 1, this simply returned a HTML page when when /part1 is requested.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the frontend, I use a simple JS script to make a external call to an open source ip (api.ipify.org) which retrieves a users IP.
                        I also use a built in library to retrieve the users timezone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, I store a cookie containing a simple counter. Every time the user revists the page, I check the cookie, create one if not present,
                        and then increment the counter. The counter is displayed to the user by modifying the HTML.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="documentation-section">
                    <div class="documentation-subtitle">Part 2</div>
                    <span class="documentation-subdivider"></span>
                    <p>
                        Part 2 is setup akin to part 1. I also have defined a seperate REST api which handles interactions with images. 
                        This decouples the views from the actual fetching of data (which is a pattern I resuse in part 3 and 4). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Again, a single Django view is defined which returns a basic HTML page. This page contains a couple buttons which are made
                        functional by another additional JS script. This is a simple script so I will not spend much time on it, but sufice to say
                        I use the JS setInterval / clearIntervals function to control stopping and starting the show. When a new image is selected, two
                        get requests are sent to the backend, which fetches the image meta data and downloads the image itself.
                    </p>

                    <div class="documentation-subtitle">Part 3</div>
                    <span class="documentation-subdivider"></span>
                    <p>
                        For part 3, I attempted to model the UX flow of Amazon. On Amazon, there exists a list of products that you can select for 
                        more information. Once a user has selected a product, they can sometimes customize it (change color, size etc). Finally, users can add items
                        to their cart, and then are able to view their cart. Items in their cart can be deleted, and the price updates dynamically.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Instead of a grid, I opted for rows of computers as it is easier to display component information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Amazon product list example:</b>

                    <p>
                        Below is a diagram of the website in part 3. It contains a homepage 
                        , a computers listing page, a details page, and a cart page. This will be updated again in P4. I have also included
                        The general flow a user can take while visiting the site (indicated by the arrows).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since part 3 required me to hardcode data rather than use a DB, I kept the data within a JSON file that I read via
                        a set of functions in api/api.py. This was the only section of my codebase interacting with data, making the switch
                        to a DB in part 4 much quicker and simplier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The code for part 3 is laid out as follows: part3/urls.py contain the urls which will return html files.
                        part3/views.py is responsible for the logic of rendering these files, and in certain views, is required to interact
                        with the api. The api (part/api/api.py) contains functions which interact with the JSON file, and perform read operations.
                        This is again updated in part 4 to perform full CRUD ops. part3/static contains all the static files that can be served via
                        Django's templating engine, and templates contain the actual HTML files.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="documentation-section">
                    <div class="documentation-subtitle">Part 4</div>
                    <span class="documentation-subdivider"></span>
                    <p>
                        The first step in part 4 was designing a schema. Django provides models to interact with databases instead
                        of directly working with them, but I have added a schema file called <i>schema.sql</i> which contains the raw sql statements.
                        Below is an pseudo-ER diagram of the tables. Briefly, the User table is Django's built in user (used primarly for authentication).
                        The store user contains a reference to the user, and the cart and order tables contain a total price and reference to the store user.
                        Computers are broken down into two tables. The Computer table contains the name price, and wether it is a default computer or not.
                        Default computes appear in the store (and non-default ones are assigned to users). Computers can be related to a users cart or order, and 
                        also have a specification. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The specification table contains references to components, which is an abstract model (non-existent in SQL). 
                        Instead, there is an individual table for each component, which is referenced by the computer spec. The numbers in the diagram represent the type
                        of relationship, either 1-1, 1-many, or many-many
                    </p>
                    <img src={% static 'part4/P4_ER.PNG' %} width="1200" height="800">
                    <p>
                        In this part, I first changed up api.py to use Django's QuerySet API to interact with the models. After replacing 
                        the old code interacting with the JSON file, I added functionality for creating a computer which is assigned to a user. This would
                        allow me to populate a user's cart and order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For authentication, I used Django's build in system, which uses the User model. This required me to develop login/signup screens. 
                        Once a user logs in, they can access all screens in part 4. If a user is not logged in, requests to any path other than /login
                        or /create are redirected to the login page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final flow of the website is shown below:

                        Use the top navigation bar to navigate between each of the assignments (parts 1-4). There are instructions on how to 
                        use the computer store in parts 3 and 4. For a test user, you can use the following:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Username: Testuser
