    <h3>Basic Tags</h3>
    <p>
        HTML works by generating a webpage based on tags defined in the markup language. A tag contains three parts: The opening seperator, content, and closing seperator.
        The opening and closing seperators are written as &lt;tag_name&gt;&lt;/tag_name&gt;. The content is written inside the tags and can either be basic characters, or more HTML.

    <h4>The Div: &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; </h4>
    <p>The div is the most basic tag. It is commonly used to help structure a page. It has no special preformatting.</p>
    <h4>The Paragraph: &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </h4>
    <p>The paragraph tag is commonly used to display text on a webpage since it uses preformatting. Browsers will add a blank line after a p tag.</p>
    <h4>The Head, Body and Html Tags &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; </h4>
    <p>These elements are used to define the page. Browsers will only process pages that contain a properly formatted HTML tag. All content goes inside this tag.</p>
    <p>Head tags contain metadata about the page, as well as links to both external and internal sources (such as JS scripts and CSS stylesheets).</p>
    <p>The body tag contains the actual HTML that will display in the browser window.</p>
