    <h3>XML</h3>
    <p>XML is a way of storing data. It is very similiar to Html as it is also a markup language. XML however, is more general.</p>
    <p>XML tags can be any set of characters, and by itself XML does not do anything</p>

    <p>In the above XML, the structure and names of the tags are entirely custom.</p>
    <p>XML supports styling via <i>XSL</i>. XSL allows CSS like styling as well as direct translation to HTML elements. XSL files can support css links and even JavaScript.</p>
