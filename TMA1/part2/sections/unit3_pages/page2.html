    <h3>JavaScript and AJAX</h3>
    <p>Oftentimes it is important to fetch data from other websites. This can be done using client side JavaScript with a programming technique called AJAX.</p>
    <p>AJAX is short for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML". It is used to fetch and update a web page without reloading the page itself.</p>

        The JavaScript running creates a new XmlHttpRequest which sends a request to "ajax_info.txt", a text file on the server. Then, once the request has been received,
        the element with the id "demo" has it content populated with the response information.
    </p>
    <p>This is how AJAX can be used to update web pages without a full page refresh.</p>
