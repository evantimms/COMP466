    <h3>JavaScript Continued</h3>
    <p>In addition to event listeners as covered in the previous unit, JavaScript can also be used to update the styling of an element and perform similiar functions as CSS.</p>
    <p>
        Once an object has been selected via a query (such as querySelector), the style can be accessed via the .style property. The style property is a JS object, which uses keys
        and values to assign style to an element. You can update the style of an element by indexing the object with the style name. For example, element.style['color'] = 'green' would
        make the element green.
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript can also make requests to other websites from a browser. A request uses the HTTP protocol to fetch or send data to another website. JS supports this feature using the 
        XmlHttpRequest object (and the newer fetch API). There are two common types of web requests, a POST and a GET. A GET request requests data from a server, while a POST request
        sends date to a server.
