    <h3>Introduction to Unit 3</h3>
    <p>In this unit, we will continue to look at JavaScript and also introduce two new technologies, Ajax and XML.</p>
    <p>XML is a very similiar Html in that it is a markup language, the difference being is the XML is general purpose, while Html is usually used for websites.</p>
    <p>While not strictly a web technology, Ajax is short for asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It uses the XmlHttpRequest object to fetch xml data while a site is live.</p>
