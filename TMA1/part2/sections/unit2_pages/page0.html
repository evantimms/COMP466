    <h3>Introduction to Unit 2</h3>
    <p>In additional to HTML, there are two other software technologies that are at the core of web development. These are CSS and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>CSS, also called <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i> is not a true programming language, but also a markup language that is similiar to HTML. However, instead of defining how a 
    webpage is laid out, CSS defines how a webpage looks.</p>
    <p>
        JavaScript is the other topic covered in this unit, and it is indeed a full-fledged programming language. JS runs on the client side, and is used to modify a sites behaviour.
        JS is used for a variety of functions, and is also responsible for sending requests to other websites from a webpage. These requests can do anything from fetch data, to 
        communicating with a backend server.
