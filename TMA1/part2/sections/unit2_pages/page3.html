    <h3>JavaScript and the DOM</h3>
    <p>
        The DOM is crucial for performing page interactions with JavaScript. The DOM (Document Object Model) is a representation of the html on a page.
        It can be used to interact with elements, add event listeners, and a host more options.

        When embedded in a page, JS has access to the <i>document</i> object. The querySelector method can be used to select elements (using a style familiar to our CSS selectors).
        For example, the code below selects all elements with the .sublink class, and adds an event listener which, when the element is clicked, will call two functions, fetchPage and
        setActiveLink

    <img src="sections/unit2_pages/imgs/js2.PNG"/>

        Event listeners are crucial for performing interactions with a webpage during runtime. The click event will call what is known as a callback function that is run when the
        element experiences a click event.
