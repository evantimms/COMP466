    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>
        CSS files contain items called <i>selectors</i> which apply a style to an element on the page. There are a vareity of ways to select an element on a page.
        Most commonly, CSS selectors will select based on either the classname or the id of an element. A classname offers a more broad selection, meaning multiple styles can be applied
        to the same element. A selection based on an id will only affect the element with that id.

        Above is a basic css selector. The <i>display</i> property is used to define how the element will be placed on the page. A display of None will not render the element.
        We also have margin and padding, which can add extra space to an element. Margin adds space outside of the element content, while padding adds extra space inside the content.
        The width (and sister height property) will set the size of the element. There are multiple ways of setting an element, including %, px, or em.
