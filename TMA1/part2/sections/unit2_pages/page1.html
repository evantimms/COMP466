    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>
        CSS files contain items called <i>selectors</i> which apply a style to an element on the page. There are a vareity of ways to select an element on a page.
        Most commonly, CSS selectors will select based on either the classname or the id of an element. A classname offers a more broad selection, meaning multiple styles can be applied
        to the same element. A selection based on an id will only affect the element with that id.
