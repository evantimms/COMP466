                        In this assignment, 4 different web applications were developed. A resume, built by parsing XML, a web learning module, a slideshow and an utility application.
                        In part 1, XML is parsed via an XSL file. In part 2, a small web development course teaches basic concepts in HTML, CSS, JS, AJAX and XML. In part 3 there is a slideshow application
                        of various photos. Finally, in part 4 there is a utility application which allows users to calculate mortages, income after tax and convert various measurements.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The design of this assignment started with a web application which contains all 4 parts. A top navbar is used to quickly navigate between applications. In part 1, XSL and XSD are used to render
                        a XML resume. In part 2, the web development modules are loaded via XmlHttpRequests. In part 2, there is also a sub navbar which allows navigation between all 4 units. In part 3, JavaScript functions to 
                        both check the type of transition, and then apply the proper transitions through manipulation of the images.
                    </p>
                        Finally, in part, the cacluations run off of 'change' events which occur when selection boxes are modified. This allows on-the-fly updating. 
                        Various input checking is done so that invalid calculations do not occur.

                    <p>To access each of the applications, use the top navbar. For the web learning application, navigate with the secondary navbar.</p>
                    <p>
                        In part 3, the dropdown will allow you to select the type of transtion. In part 4, again the secondary navbar can be used to navigate.
                        Selecting different items from the dropdown and editing the inputs will allow you do modify values for calcultions.
